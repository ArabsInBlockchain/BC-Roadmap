# Simple Roadmap for technical blockchain enthusiasts

This reference is not completed yet and my ultimate goal is to complete and share it as an article with the global community &quot; in **English** format &quot; and with my local community &quot; in **Arabic** format&quot;. Please feel free to suggest and collaborate.

**1. Fundamentals:**  
Before you start in web3 and decide what technical role you want to play, you need to understand the fundamentals very well.
1. Peer to peer fundamentals 
    1. **You should know**: What is it, how it works, and the difference between P2P and client server-model
    2. The best resources to learn these fundamentals are:
      1. Check the references
2. Cryptography fundamentals
   **You should know** 
    2. Hash functions
    3. digital signature
    4. public key's cryptography
    5. symmetric encryption
    6. asymmetric encryption
    7. Merkel trees  
   The best resources to learn these fundamentals are:
       1. MIT course ([first lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJquEYhiq_U&amp;list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&amp;index=1) and maybe the third as well)
       2. Chapter [1.1](https://cryptoeconomics.study/docs/en/sync/getting-started-course-overview)
       3. Check the references  

**2. Select the blockchain network you want to learn &amp; understand the architecture very well**

* Regardless of the network, you should start with learning the bitcoin fundamentals, the first successful blockchain implementation, **Why**? Because most of the documents, whitepapers, or tutorials always explain any blockchain network by holding a comparison with bitcoin. Based on your selected network, you have a different path of course but the best way for me is to start with **understanding the architecture** then how to develop and what are the available tools and so.

**You should know**: the general arch, how it works, How nodes reach consensus, and what are the main features that this network supports (e.g. support smart contracts functionality, permission blockchain or permissionless, etc.)

  10. **Different paths based on the role you want to play and based on the silks you already have**  
 Blockchain is a new technology with lots of roles that you can play but based on your end goals and your current knowledge and experience, you have your own unique path

  13. Check the references for more details
  14. **Specialize in a specific subdomain**

Blockchain is like a general umbrella that has lots of subdomains and after a while, you might need to sharpen your knowledge in a specific subdomain
